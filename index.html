    <p>Code is not an end to itself. It is but a bridge; a gateway to wide open frontiers, to new possibilities. A doorway through which new things are borne.</p>
    <p> To know code is to be your own Captain, mastering a ship to fresh digital possibilities, only bound by your imagination</p>

    <h5>About Me</h5>
    <p> I have been many things in life; worn many hats. My goal in life is to be a Jack of many trades and master of all.</p>
    <p>Currently I am part of a small start-up team whose mission is to disrupt the Advertising Sector through the use of novel digital solutions.</p>
    <p>This is the reason I joined Moringa School, to understand more when the techies in the room are talking; and not to be left completely adrift :)</p>
    <p>So far, the journey has been intense, but immensely rewarding. I look forward to many more adventures.</p>
    <p>Land Ahoy!!!!</p>

    <h5>Interests</h5>
    <p>When not coding you can find me listening to Deep House Music or playing my guitar</p>

    <h5>Portfolio</h5>
    <p>Here is a list of the projects I have worked on. I am hoping it grows fast and long.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Movies You might like</li>
        <li>How to Use Boxes</li>
        <p>The best cookie recipe. (The secret ingridient is Kenya Cane)</p>
      </ul>
